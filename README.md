**Title**: iOS TableView Pagination with Loading Indicator
**Overview:**
This document describes the implementation of a paginated table view in an iOS application using SwiftUI. The table view displays data fetched from a remote API in batches, with support for pagination. Additionally, a loading indicator is integrated to provide visual feedback to users during data fetching.

**Features:**
Paginated fetching of data from a remote API.
Display of fetched data in a UITableView with support for pagination.
Integration of a loading indicator to provide visual feedback during data fetching.
**Components:**
PostViewController.swift: The main view controller responsible for managing the table view, fetching data, and displaying the loading indicator.
PostsViewModel.swift: A view model class responsible for fetching data from the API and managing the data for the table view.
DetailPostViewController.swift: (Optional) A view controller to display detailed information for each list item.
Storyboard: Contains the UI elements including the table view, loading indicator, and any other interface elements.
Implementation Details:
PostViewController.swift:
Sets up the table view, including row height, data source, and delegate.
Configures the loading indicator and starts/stops animating it during data fetching.
Implements the fetchPosts method to fetch data from the API and reload the table view with the fetched data.
Implements the loadMoreTapped method to handle the "Load More" button tap event.
**PostsViewModel.swift:**
Manages the data fetching logic, including pagination.
Fetches data from the remote API in batches, handling errors and updating the data array.
Notifies the view controller upon completion of data fetching.
Storyboard:
Contains the UI elements including the table view, loading indicator, and any other interface elements.
Connects the table view to the ViewController class as its data source and delegate.
**Usage:**
Clone or download the project files.
Open the project in Xcode.
Review and modify the code as needed for your specific requirements.
Run the application on an iOS device or simulator.
**Notes:**
Ensure that the API endpoint is accessible and returns data in the expected format.
Modify the UI and code as needed to fit your specific application requirements.
Add error handling and edge case checks as necessary, such as network connectivity checks and API response validation.
